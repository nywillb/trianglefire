It was the deadliest industrial fire. New York. After 18 minutes 146 workers, 123 women and 23 men, were dead. The fire broke out on the 8th, 9th, 10th floors. Most of the workers were young ladies who had recently arrived from Europe. The workers had little time or opportunity to escape.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>The building had only one fire escape. The fire escape collapsed during the rescue effort. Long tables and bulky machines trapped other workers and left them in a panick. Panicked workers struggled with doors that were locked by their managers to prevent theft, and doors that opened the wrong way. There were only a few buckets of water available to douse the flames. Firefighters ladders were too short to reach the top floors and their safety nets ripped like paper. Because the owners had locked the doors to the stairwells and exits &ndash; a then-common practice to prevent workers from taking unauthorized breaks and to reduce theft. Many of the workers could not escape and jumped from the high windows. According to survivor Yetta Lubitz, the first warning of the fire on the ninth floor arrived at the same time as the fire itself. Owners Max Blanck and Isaac Harris were in the building and were able to flee by running to the roof of the building. They were indicted of first-and &nbsp;second degree manslaughter in mid-April.

On March 25, 1911, it broke out in fire at the end of the day. There were 146 deaths, but they could have been prevented because of tough working conditions. This fire added attention to the horrible working conditions facing immigrants and sweatshop workers. It was a catalyst for creating safety laws and guidelines for working factories.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>The factory was owned and managed by Max Blanck and Isaac Harris. The factory was located in downtown Manhattan on the corner of Green St. and Washington Place on the top three floors. There were loads of sewing machines all jammed together, and employed mostly non english speaking immigrants (new wave). It was actually a sweatshop because of the tough environment and 12 hour work days. There were 4 elevators, but only one of them worked and it was not easily accessible. Neither of the stairway exits were easy to open as one was locked to prevent theft and the other only could be opened from the outside. The fire escape was not large enough for all the workers to get out quickly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>The city and the owners were well aware of the fire danger in factories like Triangle, but no changes were made before the fire. This was not the first fire in a factory managed by Blanck and Harris as the Triangle factory had burned twice before and their other Diamond Waist Factory had also had a history of fire. It was a bit of a suspicious thing, but it seemed that they purposely set their factories on fire so they could get the large fire insurance. There were no sprinklers in the factory in case they needed to burn for money, and this was very devastating because this triangle fire was accidental and uncontrolled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>For history of Blanck and Harris as leaders, they were not very kind to their workers. The pay was extremely small even though every worker worked for 12 hours a day 7 days a week. They were payed $15 for a full week of working. The Ladies&rsquo; Union revolted for higher pay in 1909, but Blanck and Harris were against it and turned down the union. They kept the factory &lsquo;under control&rsquo; by hiding police inside and having them imprison revolters and they payed of political people who could have gotten them in trouble.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>On the Saturday afternoon of March 25, there were 600 people working in the Triangle Factory. One of the bins of rags caught on fire, but the attempts to put it out failed. Girls who fled by elevator were largely unsuccessful because only four trips of 12 each were made before it was burned. The people who fled by stairs burned alive because of locked doors at the end which prevented them from getting out. Those on the floors above mostly escaped by jumping to other buildings, but the girls who were trapped in the stairs started climbing upwards and jumping out the windows. The bodies of the people who jumped out landed on the hoses so it was really difficult for the firefighters to put out the fire.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>The fire lasted 18 minutes and left 146 dead. On April 5th, the living workers rallied 80,000 people to march to protest the terrible conditions. The jury who tried the case found the owners not guilty of manslaughter even though it was their fault that they died because it was too hard to escape.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Many of today&rsquo;s working laws and restrictions were created because of this American tragedy. The owners of this factory had a bad past and even after the horrible accident they continued to be sharks. There was a trial accusing the duo of manslaughter and they were sentenced to pay 75 dollars per life lost. The only issue with this is that the insurance company paid Harris and Blanck 400 dollars per life lost. With these extra funds, the two pocketed a massive $60,000 which in 2016 dollars is about $1.8 million. Instead of paying the families that lost their family member they took it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Despite a good deal of evidence that the owners and management had been horribly negligent in the fire, a grand jury failed to indict them on manslaughter charges. Still, the massacre for which they were responsible did finally compel the city to enact reform. In addition to the Sullivan-Hoey Fire Prevention Law passed that October, the</span><span><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.history.com/topics/us-states/new-york&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1457362804467000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9xcoCdMkG54axySynW-Q78nZ5WQ">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c0"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.history.com/topics/us-states/new-york&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1457362804467000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9xcoCdMkG54axySynW-Q78nZ5WQ">New York</a></span><span>&nbsp;Democratic set took up the cause of the worker and became known as a reform party.
