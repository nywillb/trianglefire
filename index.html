		<p>The factory was located just off of Washington Place. It is an old building that is stil around. A memorial is being built on the side of the factory with the names of the victims. You can see the location on a map <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=zqOOOyn9WsPg.kHITG-iSz67s" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

		<p>Max Blanck and Isaac Harris were the owners of the factory (see image <a href="#section31">below</a>). The employees were treated horribly. They were forced to work 12 hour days in appalling conditions. In order to make sure that the workers did not steal any products, the doors were locked from the outside every day during work hours. The women were forced to sit in cramped quarters while working. The building only had one fire escape, which was inadequate for evacuating the hundreds of people inside the factory.<p>

		<p>On a Saturday aftenoon, March 25th, 1911 a fire broke out while 600 workers were locked in the factory. It started as a small, controllable fire in a contained area. When a manager tried to extinguish the fire, the valve on the hose was too rusty to turn on. At the time, there was only one working elevator that could only cary 17 workers at a time. Some employees attempted to use the fire escape, which quickly broke before anyone could make it down. Workers, knowing that they were would die if they stayed in the factory, took their chances by jumping from the windows, eight stories above the busy streets of lower Manhattan. When the firefighters arrived, the jumping victims made it difficult to use their hoses. When firefighters brought out life nets to catch the people jumping out of the window, three girls jumped at the same time, breaking the net. In a mere 18 minutes, 49 workers had died of burns or smoke inhalation, 36 died in the elevator shaft, 58 died jumping from the building, and 2 died in the hospital later. A total death count of 146 people.</p>

		<p>This fire exposed the vital need to make changes to not only the building code, but also the labor laws all over the country. Rampant protests occurred, and <a href="#section3">Max Blanck and Isaac Harris</a> were accused of and sent to trial for manslaughter. They; however, were surprisingly found innocent. The building was repaired, and still stands today.  A recent design competition was held to create a memorial for the victims that lost their lives on that horrific day.</p>
